<title>I've Bought a Car for Mapping, Now What?</title>
<subtitle>First: glue an "OpenStreetMap" sticker to it</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>The author focuses on field mapping: collecting data on the move, both on passenger seat with a notebook, and behind the wheel, when you cannot spare a second to look away from the road. There will be a history of attempts at mapping as much as possible, sometimes with large-scale projects and examples of what commercial providers can do.
&lt;p&gt;
Entering data in OpenStreetMap is also a major problem: it has to be easy to be done on large scale. The topic affects mapping on feet and on bicycle, since the concepts developed will affect field mapping in general.
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the main question: do you really need a 4x4 jeep for mapping Russia?</abstract>

<title>Opengeofiction</title>
<subtitle>Using the OSM software for mapping a fictional planet</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Opengeofiction (http://ww.opengeofiction.net) is a collaborative platform for the creation of fictional maps, founded in 2013 using the OSM software stack. In this presentation, we want to describe our motivation for working with fictional maps, our fictional mapmaking history, how and why we created Opengeofiction, and how the project is currently developing. We will also highlight some of the technical challenges we encountered.
&lt;p&gt;
Employing the OSM software has taken our fictional mapmaking to a whole new level, not only for practical reasons, but also because it has allowed us to transform a somewhat solitary hobby into a collaborative activity within a growing community. While at a first glance Opengeofiction might look like a miniature version of the Openstreetmap project itself, there are also some key differences. We will explain why we consider the OSM software stack to be generally very well suited for a project like ours, but also discuss the areas where it does not quite fit as well.
&lt;p&gt;
We're looking forward to present the Opengeofiction project on the SotM-EU 2014 conference and we hope that we'll give an interesting input about how the OSM software can be used in a rather unconventional way.  And we will show you some far away countries where you’ve never been before.</abstract>

<title>Map Rendering Beyond Mapnik</title>
<subtitle>A Presentation of the Two Major FOSS Alternatives: Mapserver and Geoserver</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Discussing map rendering and tile servers in a group of OpenStreetMap activists makes it sound as if there is only one software in the world that can be used to do this job - namely, Mapnik.
&lt;p&gt;
This talk will focus on the two Major FOSS alternatives, which are less well
known outside the FOSSGIS/OSGeo community even though they predate Mapnik: Geoserver and Mapserver.
&lt;p&gt;
I will show some simple rendering examples for both of them (and Mapnik as a reference), and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each particular software.</abstract>

<title>pgmapcss - Advanced Cartography for Mapnik</title>
<subtitle>Implementing MapCSS by Moving the Cartography Into the Database</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>pgmapcss combines MapCSS - a more or less standardized map description language - with Mapnik - a widely used map renderer for vector or bitmap maps. In contrast to other attempts at using CSS-like styling, the actual cartography process (evaluating which map features should be rendered  in the current view and how) is moved into a database function (Using PL/Python3 in a PostgreSQL database). Mapnik just needs to read the final properties - e.g. geometry, widths, colors, texts, and so on. This database function is compiled by pgmapcss from the MapCSS style sheet.
&lt;p&gt;
There are many advantages to this idea:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing MapCSS simplifies writing style sheets for Mapnik, as there's no longer a separation into database query and styling. Often those database queries were complex and required advanced knowledge of SQL. pgmapcss takes most of the complexity away. In addition, the actual database queries for map features are optimized for each zoom level.
&lt;li&gt;MapCSS is powerful because map features can be related to each other (e.g. by relation membership or the proximity of objects). Furthermore calculations are possible (e.g. show the width of a line based on the value of a tag of the map feature). pgmapcss even offers geometric calculations (e.g. create lines between map features, rotation, buffers, …).
&lt;li&gt;As there are more than ten libraries which implement MapCSS, the language is available on different platforms and for different output media. Styles can be used with various libraries,  although there are differences between dialects, but hopefully they will converge in the future.
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Lightning Map Tiles</title>
<subtitle>A Vector Approach to Raster Maps</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Many of the maps you see created from OpenStreetMap data use the battle-hardened mod_tile software stack to render images on-demand directly from a PostGIS database. To work around some of its inherent limitations, Andy started working on an alternative  approach based on the mapnik-vector-tile software, storing the map data in protocol-buffer based vector tiles. This opens up a range of cartographic features, from faster map drawing times to easing the burden of hosting multiple styles. 
&lt;p&gt;
Andy will discuss the approaches taken, the pitfalls encountered and the future possibilities made possible using this vector tile approach.</abstract>

<title>Tesselator’s Delight</title>
<subtitle>Introduction to OpenStreetMap for WebGL</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>In the past couple years, WebGL has moved from an emerging technology to a widely supported one, providing a promising &amp; powerful toolkit for rendering OSM data in the browser. But WebGL is often daunting and foreign to web programmers, and surprisingly few resources are available to learn. 
&lt;p&gt;
In this talk I hope to help demystify WebGL for OSM, introducing the basics of a rendering pipeline using open source code examples, including: getting data from the server via GeoJSON or binary vector tiles, turning OSM geometries into WebGL-compliant triangle primitives ("tessellation"), constructing neatly joined polygonal line segments for roads and other pathways, extruding building outlines into 3D models, and using WebGL vertex and fragment shaders to alter effects like lighting direction and viewer perspective. 
&lt;p&gt;
All presented code is open source and also available as a plugin for Leaflet JS, making it easily accessible to developers who want to experiment with adding WebGL and 3D components to their maps.</abstract>

<abstract>I'll give you an introduction to OSM Buildings, a project to visualize OpenStreetMap building geometry in modern web browsers. You'll learn what its render modes are and how easily it integrates with existing web map engines.
&lt;p&gt;
And if you are familiar with the project already, there are a lot new data sources to discover and user interaction got a big step forward.
&lt;p&gt;
Furthermore I’ll explain how OSM Buildings compares to similar projects and where it stands out. For future plans, you'll see why there won't be another gray 3d blocks engine.

<title>2.5D Maps and Bird Views with Blender</title>
<subtitle>Creating 2.5D Maps and Bird Views with OpenStreetMap and Blender</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>2.5D maps are ordinary 2D maps in the web Mercator projection enhanced with a layer of 3D buildings rendered in the oblique projection. A birdview is an attractive way to realistically represent neighborhood. Realistic 3D models of buildings are used in both cases.
&lt;p&gt;
Blender open source software is used for both 3D modelling and 3D rendering. To perform georeferencing of each 3D building, OSM data are imported into Blender as flat objects in the transverse Mercator map projection. One places a 3D model at the correct position by moving and rotating it over the imported OSM data. The corresponding geographic coordinates and rotation angle are saved in a Blender file or in a database. Whole cities can be composed in this way.
&lt;p&gt;
There are two methods to create 2.5D maps. In the first method every 3D object is rendered in the oblique projection as a separate graphic symbol. Mapnik's PointSymbolizer is employed to render those images at the center of the corresponding object. In the second method all 3D objects are rendered in the oblique projection in one image. The image is georeferenced and rendered on the map as a raster layer. In both methods 3D objects are scaled in accordance with their latitude to take distortion of the Mercator projection into account.
&lt;p&gt;
3D objects must be placed on the terrain for bird views. SRTM data are used for that purpose. If necessary, terrain data are edited manually in Blender. Another key problem for bird views is to develop attractive 3D representation for numerous street objects like trees, street lights, fences, benches, bus stops, etc.</abstract>

<title>Cartographically Plausible Label Placement</title>
<subtitle>A Multi-criteria Model for Good Point-label Placement on OSM Maps</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>The cartographic label placement is a very important aspect of a map production. This task is essential for both traditional and automated cartography. Every OSM-based map is annotated using a labeling algorithm in one of the existing toolkits for rendering maps.  However, none of these algorithms is able to take into account a rich set of well-established cartographic guidelines for feature annotation used by human cartographers. Assigning names to point-features is one of the map lettering tasks.
&lt;p&gt;
In our talk we present an approach, expressed as a multi-
criteria optimization model, that complies with almost all well-defined cartographic placement principles and requirements for point-feature label placement. We show how this approach allows significantly increase toponym density on an OSM-based map without effecting readability and legibility. </abstract>

<title>Everything But Directions</title>
<subtitle> All the Other Exciting Things You Can Do With Routing</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>The talk explores the benefits of a state-of-the-art routing engine that go beyond the means to get simple driving or walking directions. We explore how 
routing is used as a building block not only to sophisticated data analysis but also in other new and exciting areas. Whether it is applied to calcaluate the walkability of neighborhoods, the matching of riders and drivers for carpooling, or even the monitoring for vandalism in the OpenStreetMap database, 
among a couple of further use cases. And in many cases these questions can even be answered in real-time without any noticeable delay, delivering a superior performance.
&lt;p&gt;
With the challenge of handling an ever-growing data set, it is important to use methods that handle data efficiently and can keep up with the data growth and change rates. The talk shows the combination of algorithm engineering, originated in the fundamental research of academia, and the crowd-sourced data 
of OpenStreetMap delivers not only superior features but also a superior user experience.</abstract>

<title>BikeDistrict - The Smart City by Bicycle</title>
<subtitle>Crowdsourced Tools to Support Urban Cyclists and Urban Bike Planning</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>In the context of the optimization of resources to devote to bicycle mobility, the two-years experience of the BikeDistrict project will be presented.
&lt;p&gt;
BikeDistrict is primarily a web and mobile application working as a free navigation tool, suggesting the urban bike-friendly paths. 
An intelligent "street rating" system has been developed for the BikeDistrict map interface with the double purpose of:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing the complete customization of the bike path, according to the specific needs of the user,
&lt;li&gt;contemporarily collect and aggregate users "street ratings" to better inform the routing algorithm, and the bike network database, with the final aim of providing the best possible routes for the different categories of urban cyclists. 
&lt;/ul&gt;
BikeDistrict is then configured as an urban bike mobility monitoring and analysis device. BikeDistrict has the ability to identify critical infrastructural gaps, to evaluate the potential benefits of specific interventions on the bicycle network and in general to support the planning activities by providing real-time-data and analysis related to the infrastructure condition and demand patterns. BikeDistrict is capable of collecting valuable information about the bike mobility demand (e.g 400 000 origin/destination itineraries in the city of Milan during 2013) and regarding the perception of quality of the road infrastructure and the bike facilities, expressed directly by the bike users.</abstract>

<title>The use of OpenStreetMap Data in Journey Planning</title>
<subtitle>An Example from Railway Routing</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>The continually improving accuracy, grade of detail and completeness in OSM data on the one hand and the always rising demand for data with higher information density, has drawn the attention of public transport operators and autorities towards OSM. Furthermore open governmental data becomes more and more important to public transport services and the idea of OSM supplements this approach.
&lt;p&gt;
Mentz Datenverarbeitung (mdv) is developing journey planning systems and therefore has recently implemented the support of OSM data into their systems. A key aspect of journey planning is the georeferencing of the data in a GIS. In this talk the various aspects of railway and tramway routing will be presented. The intention is, to take the example of rail-bound routing and discuss the challenges as well as the benefits of OSM data for public transport and the implications for the different stakeholders: public transport providers, public transport users and the broad OpenStreetMap community.

<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Kort ist a mobile web app to fix OpenStreetMap data. It runs on the most commond browsers. The app uses the concept of gamification. Game-like elements like points (so called 'Koins') are collected by the players by fulfilling a mission, like adding names to POIs without one. All proposed solutions are validated by other players. If 3 players aggreed on a proposal it is integrated on OpenStreetMap.
&lt;p&gt;
This is a report about our efforts to let volunteers contribute additional mission types. Besides restructions of mission types and internal refactoring issues, the main question is, how to design the user and machine-oriented interface. (http://www.kort.ch)</abstract>

<abstract>OpenStreetMap is set to cover more and more addresses. This talk demonstrates a tool designed to automatically detect missing house numbers, by comparing data from OSM with data retrieved from a city council or similar authority. The government data doesn't have to have a geo component - simple lists are sufficient. 
&lt;p&gt;
This approach has been used with good results in various places in Germany, and also includes a method to generate feedback to the administration (whose data is often less than perfect).</abstract>

<title>Identifying Elements at Flood Risk with Volunteered Geographic Information</title>
<subtitle>An Approach based on OpenStreetMaps with a Case Study in Cologne</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>The identification of elements at risk is an essential part in Hazard Risk Assessment. Especially for recurring natural hazards like floods, an updated database with information about critical elements at flood risk (e.g. schools, hospitals etc.) is fundamental to support crisis preparedness and response activities. However, acquiring and maintaining an up-to-date database with elements at risk requires both detailed local knowledge and hazard-specific constraints, being often a challenge for local communities due to lack of expertise and appropriate funding, deferred priorities and complex political determinations.
&lt;p&gt;
We present a new approach for leveraging OpenStreetMap data to automatically identify hazard-specific elements at risk. We provide a new data model for extracting elements at flood risk from OSM and conduct a case study in the city of Cologne, Germany to validate our approach. 
&lt;p&gt;
Our results show that the identification of elements at flood risk with citizen-generated geodata is a suitable and cost-effective alternative for supporting local government and communities in risk assessment and emergency planning. Furthermore, the use of OSM may engage citizens in risk preparedness and risk reduction activities and thus increase risk awareness of local communities, closing the gap between citizens and governmental bodies. </abstract>

<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>I would like to share and talk about my experience with the free map SardSOS that I've created while confronting with the devastating floods which damaged my Island, Sardinia in November 2013(http://sardsos.crowdmap.com/). I've built an open crowdmap on the Ushahidi platform which it was based on OpenStreetMap, crowd-data and volunteer's collaboration, and mapping. The map has been visited by nearly 14.000 people in the first week.&lt;p&gt;
This project has also triggered the release of open geo-data from the Sardinian Government. It pushed the italian mainstream media to talk about OSM and inspired other Regions/Public Administrations towards open their data and look at OSM with interest, finally seeing its opportunities. 
&lt;p&gt;
I also have done an independent, online research, after the emergency, to check the use and the perception of people of OpenStreetMap and mapping for emergencies. I
would like also to share at the SOTM  the results of the open survey done for this research. My experience, is the proof of the power of OSM, even if I'm a mapper since just one year the power of the platform and the community is just incredible.</abstract>

<abstract>As OSM is gaining more traction for usage in navigation and routing for mobile devices and applications, it’s important to understand the differences between commercial map data and OSM data, particularly for effective route calculations. 
&lt;p&gt;
Following a brief history of routing engines that were primary developed for high performance usage on mobile devices, I will share what and where the challenges are in OSM versus commercial/professional data, from the perspective of having been entrenched in both worlds for many years.</abstract>

<abstract>Planetary Nervous System, Global Participatory Platform, Social Information Technologies: How to Create a Better World
&lt;p&gt;
It probably started with Linux, then came Wikipedia and Open Street Map. Crowd-sourced information systems
are central for the Digital Society to thrive.
&lt;p&gt;
So, what's next? I will introduce a number of concepts such as
the Planetary Nervous System, Global Participatory Platform, Interactive Virtual Worlds, User-Controlled
Information Filters and Reputation Systems, and the Digital Data Purse. I will also introduce ideas such as the Social Mirror, Intercultural Adapter, the Social Protector and Social Money as tools to create a better world. These can help us to avoid systemic instabilities, market failures, tragedies of the commons, and exploitation, and to create the framework for a Participatory Market Society, where everyone can be better off.

<abstract>We want to create a photo representation of the world, a map with photos of every place on Earth.
Current street view alternatives have so many limitations from the fact that they are created using cars with camera rigs, focusing on streets. There are many places on this planet that they will never get to, and even the places they do get to will not get updated as often as you might want them to. Together we can fix that. Also, Mapillary wants to provide the image data to OSM for enhancing that data. We need help in choosing the right license for the images!

<title>Geocoding; the Missing Link for OSM?</title>
<subtitle>Geocoding isn't easy and yet it's vital to the success of OSM</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>So many uses of maps need some form of geocoding. Geocoding is simple, just strip out known stop words and look up the place or address in a gazetteer and hey presto, instant coordinates. The same applies for reverse geocoding, it's easy. Right? But it's not easy and it's not trivial. While OSM continues to make massive strides towards being the definitive source of open mapping data, geocoding has ... languished a bit.
&lt;p&gt;
This talk will tell you why geocoding isn't easy. It will tell you about why once you can geocode in one country it doesn't mean you can automatically geocode in another country. It will also tell you about why Nomimatim isn't the only open source geocoder that's out there. And this talk may have something exciting from Lokku and OpenCage Data to announce, which may just be related to geocoding.
&lt;p&gt;
Geocoding shouldn't be the missing link for open maps and for OSM; this talk will tell you why.</abstract>

<subtitle>A New OpenStreetMap Geocoder With Elasticsearch</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Users of mobile mapping applications expect a forward geocoder with autocomplete and flexible search results, as well as an accurate reverse geocoder. Recent versions of Elasticsearch offer both excellent geo support and a fast completion suggester.
&lt;p&gt;
Pelias is a new open-source project with tools for indexing OpenStreetMap, Geonames, and Quattroshapes data into Elasticsearch, and a simple server to handle queries and auto-complete suggestions.
&lt;p&gt;
A major goal of the project is to make it easy to adapt the query parser and data pre-processors to the requirements of specific languages and locations. For example, users in New York City might require searchable intersections, while French-speaking users in Quebec might need a different query parser from those in France. It should be easy to edit these rules such that little programming experience is necessary.
&lt;p&gt;
This presentation will cover the basic architecture and data strategies of the project, provide some details into Elasticsearch's geo and completion support, and will have a big focus on how to contribute.

<title>Sparse Editing</title>
<subtitle>Editing Large-Scale Objects</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>While OpenStreetMap has an impressive data quality on small scale objects, large scale objects are often only mapped in low quality. One example is the often discussed subject of mapping public transport services, and indeed these are far from complete or consistent.
&lt;p&gt;
The deeper reason for this is that editing large scale objects is exceptionally hard: This results from the fact that the larger an object is, the more spatial dependencies it is involved in. For example, a public transport relation can be damaged by each and every roundabout or lane mapping attempt.
&lt;p&gt;
In this talk we will analyse which typical kinds of dependencies exist and discuss various approaches like route suggestion by involving a route engine or mapping on a filtered subset of data. As a hands-on example it is shown how to efficiently recover a lost name tag on the river Rhine by editing an area of more than a hundred kilometers extent in JOSM.

<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Wall·E is a maintenance robot I have been operating in OSM-DE since the end of 2012. The edits performed range from simple tasks such as the reduction of repeatedly referenced nodes in
ways to relatively sophisticated corrections in addr:* tags. Compared to other robots, Wall·E still has a relatively low total edit count (roughly 30k by early 2014), but this also
reflects the rather conservative editing strategy employed, which includes several precautions to avoid misfixes.
&lt;p&gt;
The talk will cover some of the technical aspects (filtering patterns, tools involved, safety measures) as well as the robot's history starting from xybot, an earlier OSM robot which served as
a model for many of Wall·E's functions, and some remarks on the role of robots within the social system of OSM.</abstract>

<abstract>Although the OSM community has realized several indoor projects, an Android application for viewing indoor maps remains unavailable. As part of an electric mobility project, the group at TU Chemnitz has developed an application that fills this gap.
&lt;p&gt;
The concept and an overview of the chosen implementation shall be presented here. The talk will focus in particular on the usage of the mapsforge library, which is widely used for creating outdoor maps, and how it was applied to draw indoor maps. The indoor data itself is described with the scheme proposed by Marcus Goetz (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IndoorOSM).
&lt;p&gt;
Furthermore future developments and possible usage scenarios for this map application are presented.

<title>Creating a Bridge Between OpenSteetMap and Wikipedia: Wikipedia-tags-in-OSM</title>
<subtitle>A Tool to Add Wikipedia Tags in OSM and Coordinates in Wikipedia</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>When you visit a Wikipedia article for a monument or a place (e.g. the Colosseum) you can find a link which will display the same object highlighted on OpenStreetMap: this tool is called WIWOSM and it was created by German mapper and Wikipedian Kolossos. It works using the "Wikipedia" tags, i.e. wikipedia=language:article, added by volunteers
in OSM.
&lt;p&gt;
This presentation introduces a new tool called Wikipedia-tags-in-OSM (WTOSM): a script producing a set of web pages that makes easier to add the "Wikipedia" tags in OSM using JOSM "remote control" feature, and, at the same time makes easy adding coordinates in Wikipedia articles using the {{Coord}} template and OAuth authentication. This tool has been developed by user Groppo, with a great involvement by
the Italian OSM and Wikipedia communities.
&lt;p&gt;
In this presentation I will present WTOSM, which is available online at http://bit.ly/wikipedia-tags-in-OSM, and its features and how it
can be used also to map places when the only information available is the Wikipedia article abstract, using Nuts4Nuts (presented at SotM13,
see http://bit.ly/presentation-Nuts4Nuts-SOTM). This project is realeased as free software (GPLv3) and its source code is available on
github.
&lt;p&gt;
We believe that this tool can help the OpenStreetMap community to discover new objects to map from Wikipedia pages and also it can
create a bridge among the two projects.</abstract>

<title>Data Consistency in OpenStreetMap</title>
<subtitle>Monitoring Consistency using Spatial Features and Tag Semantics</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Monitoring consistency and reliability of maps is an important task when Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is involved and OpenStreetMap provides a good testing ground to develop operative methodologies. The aim of this work is to present some procedures to be instanced as a web application. Two questions about data consistency are considered: for any given region (I) Is the level of spatial features density at a given scale enough for a suitable geographical description? (II) Is the semantics of the features (described by keys and tags) consistent and comprehensive?
&lt;p&gt;
To answer the first question we are developing a method based on the spatial scales derived from the existing OSM zoom levels; having selected a bounding box and a given zoom level a given area can be sampled for its geographical features (vector-point and polygons) on which it is possible to assess spatial indexes. Scale-dependent indices such as Lacunarity and K-ripley Index are applied on the sampled features in order to measure the spatial homogeneity of the map. This analysis can be repeated on historical data at different points in time to monitor its development. 
&lt;p&gt;
For the second question, considering OSM tags as a dynamic text corpus we have applied text mining methodologies: after selecting a well-mapped reference region we can then apply Zipf’s Law to assess his semantic profile; thus for any other given region the statistical deviations from Zipf's theoretical fits obtained from the reference can be measured. Zipf's deviations can then be used as a tool to measure the degree of geographical description of an area. 
&lt;p&gt;
This talk presents preliminary results from work done by Alfonso Crisci (IBIMET-CNR), Maurizio Napolitano (FBK-Trento), Francesca De Chiara (FBK-Trento), Valentina Grasso (IBIMET-CNR, LaMMA Consortium), and Cristian Consonni (FBK-Trento).</abstract>

<title>Beyond the 3 "R"s</title>
<subtitle>The Challenges of Using OpenStreetMap Data for Analysis</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>talk</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>Most uses of OSM data fall into 3 categories, the 3 "R"s: Rendering (cartography), Routing, and 'Rummaging' (search, geolocation). However, the large and diverse sets of data within OSM also have considerable, and under-appreciated potential for answering analytical questions.
&lt;p&gt;
The patchiness and lack of completeness of OSM data significantly hinders its use for analysis.  But there are other aspects of the data which don't help either.

Examples of how OSM data can be used for analysis will be presented to demonstrate both the potential and the underlying issues.
&lt;p&gt;
Analysis places different demands on how data is mapped in OSM: a focus on using specific subsets of the data will highlight inconsistencies, and identify missing information. Furthermore it is often the case that data that is notionally derivable from OSM is not so in practice. 
&lt;p&gt;
Making OSM data usable for analytics tests and stresses how the data are mapped in ways which are quite different from the typical uses. Therefore particular analysis problems can help enrich and extend how and what we map.</abstract>

<abstract>This is an opportunity for interested mappers to work together in the field in a variety of woodland and wetland (reed-beds, open water, marsh, etc.) habitats which are of interest to participants and discuss how to recognise and distinguish the features of those habitats in such a way that they can be mapped. 

The anticipated destination is nature reserve Weingar\-tener Moor/Bruchwald Grötzingen, which is about 10\,km NE of Karlsruhe, and easily reached by a short train journey from Karlsruhe Hbf. We will meet at Karlsruhe Hbf at 08:00 in time for the 08:10 train to Weingarten (Baden), Meeting point at the entrance to the platforms. The nature reserve is around 1 km walk from Weingarten Bhf. We will spend between 2.5--3 hours in the nature reserve. Return train at either 11:57 or 12:36.

Participants are advised to bring appropriate footwear, sunscreen/rain gear, mosquito-repellant, and something to drink. Binoculars, hand-lens and tree and plant field guides will also be useful, although these will be available to consult or borrow.

<title>Overpass API v0.7.50</title>
<subtitle>The temporal dimension</subtitle>
<track></track>
<type>workshop</type>
<language>EN</language>
<abstract>With OpenStreetMap getting more mature, it becomes more important to track changes. But to track changes is difficult for various reasons: Changeset comments can be misleading, destruction may be hidden in innocent looking changes, and the sheer amount of data prohibits a complete manual review.
&lt;p&gt;
For that reason Overpass API provides from version 0.7.50 on the complete history since the license change. We present the commands to access that data: One can get the results as they were at any chosen point of time in the past. One can get even a changefile of what has changed between two points in time. This is complemented by a feature to print the full geometry of a way or relation without referring explicitly to its nodes.
&lt;p&gt;
We explain how both together support the concept of basic OSM editing operations, how they allow to build powerful client JavaScript only websites that allow tracking of changes with arbitrary search criteria. We will discuss what remains to do to build a complete and logically consistent revert tool based on Overpass API v0.7.50.
